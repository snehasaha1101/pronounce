📚 PronounceIt Chrome Extension

There are many words whose pronunciation we may not know. Copying and pasting the word into Chrome to find its pronunciation can be time-consuming. Therefore, I thought of designing a Chrome extension that pronounces words instantly with just a right-click!

🚀 Features

Highlight a word and hear its pronunciation instantly.

Simple right-click context menu integration.

Supports Chrome's text-to-speech engine.

Works across all websites.
